# TwitterTweetPredictor

The Scientific Method
1. Define a question (revised): Can machine learning predict within the confines of Twitter what influences a Twitter userâ€™s Tweets (consciousness) and if that has any affect on the collective Tweets (consciousness) of Twitter users?

2. Gather information and resources (observe)
Types of Tweets:
Tweets
Retweets
Quote Tweets
Mentions
Replies
Promoted Tweets

Assumptions:
Twitter user will Tweet one of the different types of Tweets

Content of Tweets will either be:
  *Original content - source can be anything
  *Retweet content from a Twitter user - source directly from a Twitter user
  *Quote Tweets from a Twitter user - source directly from a Twitter user
  *Content from a promoted Tweet - source from advertisement
  *Mention a Twitter user - source can be anything, but is directed at specific Twitter user
  *Reply to a Tweet from a Twitter user - source is from a Twitter user

3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
5. Analyze the data
6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis
7. Publish results
8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists)
